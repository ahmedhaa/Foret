#  Forest Fire – Simulation & Visualization

This repository contains **two distinct projects** focused on simulating and visualizing a forest fire:

1.  A **C project** named test with a graphical interface using **Ez-Draw**, developed and run with **Visual Studio 2022**
2.  An **Angular 19 project** named feu-foret-angular  for the web interface  using **Canvas** (visualization, statistics, and user interaction)
3.  The fire is initialized at the center of the forest to make the simulation more visible and observe the fire's behavior.

+This feature is implemented in both projects: C (simulation with Ez-Draw) and Angular (web interface with Canvas).

    ##  C Project – Forest Fire Simulation

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2022]

- ###  Interface

- Graphical simulation of a forest fire
- Click with the **mouse** to start a fire in a tree
- The program logs the coordinates of the fire's starting points, e.g.,
Fire started at (69, 22)
Fire started at (67, 68)
Fire started at (31, 89)
- Automatic updates via a **timer**

  ##  Angular Project – Web Interface (Angular 19)
  - Graphical simulation of a forest fire
  - Added buttons to **start/stop the fire** in the simulation
- Added a **refresh button** to reload the simulation state
