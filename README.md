#  Forest Fire – Simulation & Visualization

This repository contains **two distinct projects** focused on simulating and visualizing a forest fire:

1. 🔥 A **C project** named test with a graphical interface using **Ez-Draw**, developed and run with **Visual Studio 2022**
2. 🌐 An **Angular 19 project** named feu-foret-angular  for the web interface (visualization, statistics, and user interaction)

    ## 🔧 C Project – Forest Fire Simulation

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2022]

- ###  Interface

- Graphical simulation of a forest fire
- Click with the **mouse** to start a fire in a tree
- The program logs the coordinates of the fire's starting points, e.g.,
Fire started at (69, 22)
Fire started at (67, 68)
Fire started at (31, 89)
- Automatic updates via a **timer**
